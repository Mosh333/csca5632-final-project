    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s data-driven world, the ability to **uncover structure and meaning from unlabeled data** represents one of the most powerful frontiers in machine learning.  \n",
    "While supervised learning depends on extensive labeled datasets, many real-world domains contain **vast quantities of raw, unannotated information**—such as images, text, medical scans, or sensor data—where manual labeling is costly or infeasible.  \n",
    "Here, [**unsupervised learning**](https://biztechmagazine.com/article/2025/05/what-are-benefits-unsupervised-machine-learning-and-clustering-perfcon) plays a pivotal role: it enables algorithms to reveal hidden patterns, latent representations, and natural groupings within data without external supervision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning drives [innovation across diverse domains](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7983091/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Data exploration and pattern discovery:**](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/mas.21602) Enables open-ended analysis of large, high-dimensional datasets to uncover hidden structures, correlations, and trends—reducing dimensionality and aiding human interpretation, such as exploring mass spectrometry data across large experimental datasets.  \n",
    "- [**Computer vision:**](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning/) Groups unlabeled images by similarity, compresses data via [PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html), or learns visual embeddings through self-supervised methods like [SimCLR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709).  \n",
    "- [**Natural language processing:**](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-is-the-role-of-unsupervised-learning-in-nlp) Learns semantic relationships in text through [Word2Vec](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781) or discovers latent topics using [Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v3/blei03a.html).  \n",
    "- [**Healthcare and biomedical research:**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31891765/) Facilitates the discovery of hidden disease patterns, comorbidity clusters, and patient subgroups from large-scale electronic health records—enabling better understanding of latent traits, risk domains, and disease progression, such as identifying novel comorbidity patterns in aging cohorts.  \n",
    "- [**Autonomous systems and robotics:**](https://fiveable.me/introduction-autonomous-robots/unit-7/unsupervised-learning/study-guide/rNorV1tsC0TeCPOO) Maps environments, groups sensor inputs, and learns spatial representations without labeled supervision.  \n",
    "- [**Recommender and personalization systems:**](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/12/2/185) Clusters users or content to generate recommendations when explicit ratings are unavailable.\n",

    "Together, these examples highlight how unsupervised learning forms the foundation of **exploratory data analysis** and **representation learning**, allowing models to extract structure from raw data before labels exist.\n",

    "#### 1.1 Project Overview and Objectives\n",
    "Here we discuss the selected data source and the unsupervised learning problem we aim to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Gather Data, Determine the Method of Data Collection and Provenance\n",
    "This project uses the **[Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ) dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/animal-faces)** — a publicly available image dataset originally curated by **Andrew Mvd** on Kaggle under a **CC BY-NC license**.  \n",
    "AFHQ contains **over 16,000 high-quality animal face images** across three balanced categories: **cats, dogs, and wildlife**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Kaggle description:\n",
    "> “This dataset, also known as Animal Faces-HQ (AFHQ), consists of 16,130 high-quality images at 512×512 resolution.  \n",
    "> There are three domains of classes, each providing about 5000 images.  \n",
    "> By having multiple (three) domains and diverse images of various breeds per each domain, AFHQ sets a challenging image-to-image translation problem.  \n",
    "> The classes are: Cat, Dog, and Wildlife.”\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, images are **resized to XxY pixels**, normalized to a [0, 1] range, and converted to **RGB tensors** (three-channel numerical arrays representing red, green, and blue intensities).  \n",
    "These preprocessing steps prepare the data for feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and clustering.  \n",
    "The dataset’s high resolution, balance across categories, and visual diversity make it well-suited for evaluating **unsupervised image representation learning** and **clustering performance**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3 Identify an Unsupervised Learning Problem\n",
    "The goal of this project is to test whether **unsupervised learning algorithms** can **group animal face images into their correct categories** — cats, dogs, and wildlife — **based only on visual similarity**, without using any labels.  \n",
    "In other words, can the models automatically recognize and cluster similar-looking animals together?\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, visualization of image features using **[t-SNE](https://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/)** and **[PCA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html)**, and the application of clustering algorithms such as **[K-Means](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html)**, **[DBSCAN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN.html)**, and **[Agglomerative Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering performance is evaluated using the **[Silhouette Score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html)**, **[Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html)**, and **[Normalized Mutual Information (NMI)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.normalized_mutual_info_score.html)**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the results of multiple unsupervised models — and contrasting them with a small supervised baseline classifier — this project shows both the **strengths and limitations** of unsupervised learning for basic image classification tasks.  \n",
    "The findings demonstrate how clustering can uncover **hidden visual structure** in data and serve as a foundation for more advanced **self-supervised** or **semi-supervised** learning approaches."
